isodate : ( str | epoch ), format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SS[.MMM]Z

  An `isodate` represents a timestamp, which can be expressed either
  as an epoch number (i.e. the number of seconds since 1/1/1970) or as
  an ISO 8601 Combined Date/Time string in UTC timezone. Note that
  both the epoch and the string support sub-second resolution.
